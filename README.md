# GitHub Serverless Application

In this repository I am exploring to see whehter it is possible to develop a GitHub Application
(one that appears in the GitHub Marketplace) which would be just a basic GitHub Pages hosted
static site.

GitHub Apps are given permissions using OAuth and there are client-only OAuth flows, so in
theory this should work as long as GitHub provides a way to use one of those. This is a stream
of thoughts kind of a document where I add information as I progress with the experiment. If you
only want to find out what the result it, scroll all the way below and if there is a resolution,
you'll find it there.

You can find the GitHub Pages hosted static site of this repository at this link:

- [ ] Submit the application to GitHub Marketplace
- [ ] Try to wire up OAuth using a client only flow
